    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Salmorejo is a cold tomato soup without the extra veggies, and is served in a bowl and garnished with boiled egg and ham. It's often enhanced with garlic, and then blended with stale bread, extra virgin olive oil, and sherry vinegar.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Spanish virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sofrito. While the sofrito is simmering, make the rice. Pour approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil into a medium-size saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Add the rice into the pan and coat the rice with the oil. Pour enough water to cover the rice into the pan and bring to a boil. Add salt to taste. Then, reduce the heat, loosely cover and allow to simmer until rice is cooked, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4-inch olive oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. Fry the eggs one at a time in the olive oil, sprinkling with a dash of salt.</li>
            <li>Place a scoop of rice on each plate and make a depression in the center. Ladle some of the sofrito into the depression. Carefully top with a fried egg. Serve immediately with a baguette.</li>
        </ol>
