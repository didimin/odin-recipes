    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, pronounced ah-li-oh ee o-li-oh, is a traditional Italian dish made with just pasta, garlic, simple seasonings, and olive oil. This easy, economical pasta recipe takes less than 20 minutes and is filled with so much delicious garlicky flavor!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sofrito</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Spanish virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked rice</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cups water</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sofrito. While the sofrito is simmering, make the rice. Pour approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil into a medium-size saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Add the rice into the pan and coat the rice with the oil. Pour enough water to cover the rice into the pan and bring to a boil. Add salt to taste. Then, reduce the heat, loosely cover and allow to simmer until rice is cooked, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4-inch olive oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. Fry the eggs one at a time in the olive oil, sprinkling with a dash of salt.</li>
            <li>Place a scoop of rice on each plate and make a depression in the center. Ladle some of the sofrito into the depression. Carefully top with a fried egg. Serve immediately with a baguette.</li>
        </ol>
