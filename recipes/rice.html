    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Arroz Cubano, also known as Arroz a la Cubana, is a classic dish of rice and fried egg that is eaten in many Spanish-speaking countries. As with any dish that is popular—and cooked in a variety of regions—there are versions unique to every household. Some cooks prepare the rice with garlic, while others prepare simply white rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sofrito</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Spanish virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked rice</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cups water</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sofrito. While the sofrito is simmering, make the rice. Pour approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil into a medium-size saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Add the rice into the pan and coat the rice with the oil. Pour enough water to cover the rice into the pan and bring to a boil. Add salt to taste. Then, reduce the heat, loosely cover and allow to simmer until rice is cooked, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4-inch olive oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. Fry the eggs one at a time in the olive oil, sprinkling with a dash of salt.</li>
            <li>Place a scoop of rice on each plate and make a depression in the center. Ladle some of the sofrito into the depression. Carefully top with a fried egg. Serve immediately with a baguette.</li>
        </ol>
